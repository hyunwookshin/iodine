# Iodine — Developer Notes

## What This Is

A web-based IDE shell for the Iodine project. Developers can open a local folder, browse its file tree, and read/edit files in a Monaco-powered code editor. The right panel has three tabs: **Simulation** (placeholder for planned network mocking / throttling features), **Coding Assistant** (a streaming chat powered by Claude, GPT, or Gemini that can read, write, and search files in the open workspace), and **System View** (an interactive SVG graph editor for architecture diagrams, with an AI-powered Generate button that explores the workspace with file tools).

## How to Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Run both client and server
npm run dev
```

- **Client** (React + Vite): http://localhost:5173
- **Server** (Express): http://localhost:3001

Once running, open a project via **File → Open Project** in the menu bar (browser directory picker) or click **Open Folder** in the left sidebar to type an absolute path.

All file reads and writes are validated against the workspace root to prevent path traversal. Git mutation endpoints resolve absolute paths from `repoRoot + relPath` and use `execFileAsync` (no shell injection risk).

## Key Behaviors

- **Open Project (menu bar)**: Click **File → Open Project…** to open the OS directory picker. The browser provides the folder name (not the absolute path — this is a browser security restriction). The client sends the folder name to `POST /api/workspace/find`, which searches `~/`, `~/*/` (one level of home subdirs) for a directory with that name. If found, the absolute path is confirmed via `POST /api/workspace/open`. If not found, a fallback dialog appears with the folder name pre-filled so the user can type the full path.
- **Open Folder (sidebar)**: Click the folder icon in the left sidebar and type an absolute path directly. Same `POST /api/workspace/open` call under the hood.
- **Open a file**: Click any file in the tree. It opens as a tab in the editor.
- **Save**: `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`. An amber dot on the tab indicates unsaved changes.
- **Workspace persistence**: The server writes the workspace path to `~/.iodine/workspace` on every `setRootPath()` call and reads it back on startup. Workspace survives `tsx watch` server restarts triggered by file saves during development.
- **File watcher**: When a workspace is open, `WorkbenchLayout` mounts `useFileWatcher`, which opens a persistent SSE connection to `GET /api/files/watch`. The server uses `fs.watch({ recursive: true })` on the workspace root and emits a `file-changed { path }` event (debounced 150 ms per file) whenever a file changes on disk. The client calls `refreshFile(absPath)` in response — silently re-fetching content for any file already open in a tab, so edits made outside Iodine (e.g. by the AI agent or an external editor) are reflected immediately. The SSE connection bypasses the Vite proxy for the same reason as the Coding Assistant (see DEBUGGING.md).
- **Resize panels**: Drag the thin dividers between the sidebar, editor, and right panel.
- **Switch sidebar views**: Click the branch icon in the activity bar to switch between Explorer and Source Control.
- **Source Control panel**: Click the branch icon in the activity bar. Shows the current branch, a commit textarea (Ctrl+Enter to commit), a Stage All button, and collapsible "Staged Changes" / "Changes" sections. Hover a file row to reveal stage/unstage (`+`/`−`) and discard (`↺`) buttons. Untracked files show as `U`. Discard always confirms; deleting an untracked file warns explicitly. Below the working-tree changes: **Local Branches** (click to checkout), **Remote Branches** (collapsed by default; click to checkout the corresponding local branch), and **History** (last 80 commits with ref badges — click any non-HEAD commit to check it out in detached HEAD state). A **↑ push** button in the header pushes to `origin HEAD`. All checkout and push actions guard against uncommitted changes: if any exist, a dialog offers to stash first (OK) or abort (Cancel).
- **Coding Assistant**: Click the "Coding Assistant" tab in the right panel. Select a provider and model from the dropdowns (shared with System View). The chat now shows two kinds of streaming output: regular **answer** text and subtler **thought** lines representing the agent's live reasoning. Enter sends; Shift+Enter inserts a newline. Chat history persists until the page is refreshed.
- **System View**: Click the "System View" tab. The graph is stored in `~/.iodine/<md5(workspacePath)>/system-graph.json` — persisted per workspace but not in git. Click **⚡ Generate** to run the agentic loop: the model uses `list_directory` and `read_file` tools to explore the real workspace and outputs a JSON architecture graph. A status bar shows which file is being scanned. Switch between **Graph** (interactive SVG) and **JSON** (Monaco editor) views. Nodes are draggable; scroll to zoom, drag background to pan. **↺ Layout** re-runs force-directed layout. **✓ Save** persists to disk.
- **File preview**: When a `.md` or `.html` file is active, a floating **Preview** button appears in the upper-right corner of the editor. Clicking it renders the file — markdown is rendered with `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` (dark-themed prose styles), HTML is rendered in a sandboxed `<iframe>`. Clicking **Source** returns to the Monaco editor. Switching to a non-previewable file automatically resets to source mode.
- **Revert hunk**: The Monaco editor shows git diff decorations in the gutter — a green bar for added lines, amber bar for modified lines, and a red triangle for deleted lines. Clicking a green or amber glyph immediately reverts that hunk (removes added lines / restores original content). Clicking a red triangle expands a view zone showing the deleted lines; a **↺ Revert** button inside the zone inserts those lines back. All reverts go through Monaco's `executeEdits` API so **Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z** undoes them. Contiguous changed lines are treated as a single hunk.
- **Image viewer**: Clicking a `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg` file in the file tree opens it in a dedicated image viewer instead of the Monaco text editor. The file tree shows a distinct landscape-picture icon (light blue) for image files so they are visually distinguishable. The viewer displays the image centred on a dark canvas with zoom controls (`−` / `+` buttons, click the `%` label to reset to 100%). Images are fetched from `GET /api/files/image?path=` which streams the raw binary with the correct `Content-Type` header and a `no-store` cache policy. The `isImage` flag on `OpenFile` prevents diff decorations and dirty-save logic from running for image tabs.

## Image Viewer — Implementation Details

| Layer | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| File tree icon | `FileTreeNode.tsx` | Detects `.png`/`.jpg`/`.jpeg` by extension; renders `ImageFileIcon` (SVG landscape) in light blue (`#89d4f5`) instead of the generic file icon |
| Open logic | `useOpenFiles.ts` → `isImageFile()` | Sets `isImage: true`, skips text fetch; stores empty `content` string |
| Routing | `EditorArea.tsx` | Checks `activeFile.isImage`; renders `<ImageViewer>` instead of `<MonacoEditor>` |
| Viewer UI | `ImageViewer.tsx` | Toolbar with filename + zoom controls; scrollable canvas; `transform: scale()` zoom; `pixelated` rendering above 2× |
| Server endpoint | `server/src/routes/files.ts` → `GET /api/files/image` | Path-traversal guard; reads binary with `fs.promises.readFile`; serves with `image/png` or `image/jpeg` MIME type |
| URL helper | `api/files.ts` → `getImageUrl()` | Builds the query-param URL consumed by `<img src>` in `ImageViewer` |

To add support for more image types (e.g. `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`): add the extension to `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` in both `useOpenFiles.ts` and `FileTreeNode.tsx`, and add the MIME mapping to `IMAGE_MIME` in `server/src/routes/files.ts`.

## Editor Diff Decorations & Revert Hunk — Implementation Details

| Layer | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Diff parsing | `server/src/routes/files.ts` → `parseDiff()` | Parses `git diff HEAD` output into `{ added: number[], modified: { line, originalLine }[], deleted: { afterLine, lines[] }[] }`. Modified blocks carry both the current line number and the original HEAD content so the client can restore without an extra fetch. |
| Diff fetch | `client/src/hooks/useFileDiff.ts` | Polls `GET /api/git/diff?path=` every 3 s and on window focus; exposes `DiffData` to the editor. |
| Types | `client/src/api/files.ts` | `ModifiedLine`, `DeletedBlock`, `DiffData` — shared between the hook and `MonacoEditor`. |
| Decorations | `client/src/components/editor/MonacoEditor.tsx` | Applies Monaco glyph-margin and line-background decorations for each hunk type. Deleted blocks also get a view-zone showing the removed lines when expanded. |
| Glyph click handler | `MonacoEditor.tsx` → `editor.onMouseDown` | Detects `GUTTER_GLYPH_MARGIN` clicks, groups contiguous lines into hunks, then calls the appropriate revert helper via `editor.executeEdits('revert-hunk', ...)` to preserve undo history. |
| Revert helpers | `MonacoEditor.tsx` (module-level) | `revertAdded` — deletes the line range. `revertModified` — replaces lines with `originalLine` values from diff data. `revertDeleted` — inserts removed lines back after `afterLine`. |
| CSS | `client/src/index.css` | `.git-added-glyph` / `.git-modified-glyph` get `cursor: pointer` and a hover tint; `.git-deleted-glyph` already had `cursor: pointer` for expand/collapse. |

## File Watcher — Implementation Details

| Layer | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Server watcher | `server/src/routes/files.ts` → `GET /api/files/watch` | `fs.watch(root, { recursive: true })` on the workspace root; debounces per-file events (150 ms); skips `.git/` and `node_modules/`; emits `file-changed { path }` SSE events |
| Broadcast layer | `server/src/events.ts` | Alternative broadcast infrastructure (`addClient` / `broadcast` / `watchFile`) — available for other server-initiated push events beyond file watching |
| Generic SSE route | `server/src/routes/events.ts` → `GET /api/events` | Registers the response with `addClient()`; intended for use with `broadcast()` from `events.ts` |
| Client hook | `client/src/hooks/useFileWatcher.ts` | Opens an `EventSource` to `/api/files/watch` (direct to port 3001, bypassing Vite proxy); listens for `file-changed` events; calls a stable callback ref |
| Integration | `WorkbenchLayout.tsx` | Calls `useFileWatcher(workspacePath, refreshFile)` — `refreshFile` is exposed by `useOpenFiles` and re-fetches content for any tab whose path matches the changed file |

## Menu Bar — File > Open Project

### How It Works

1. User clicks **File → Open Project…** → OS directory picker opens (`<input webkitdirectory>`).
2. Browser returns a `FileList`. The client extracts the root folder name from the first file's `webkitRelativePath` (e.g. `"myproject/src/index.ts"` → `"myproject"`).
3. Client sends `POST /api/workspace/find { name: "myproject" }`.
4. Server searches `~/myproject`, then all `~/*/myproject` (one level deep in home). Returns `{ path: "/Users/you/code/myproject" }` or `{ path: null }`.
5. If found: client calls `POST /api/workspace/open { path: "..." }` to register it, then updates UI.
6. If not found: fallback dialog shows with the folder name pre-filled for manual absolute path entry.

### Why Not Use `showDirectoryPicker()`?

The File System Access API (`showDirectoryPicker()`) gives the absolute path but is not supported in Firefox. `webkitdirectory` + server-side search was used instead for cross-browser compatibility.

### Why the Server Search Is Needed

The browser's `<input webkitdirectory>` API intentionally withholds the absolute filesystem path for security reasons. Only relative paths within the selection are exposed via `webkitRelativePath`. The server-side search is the bridge that converts the folder name back to an absolute path the server can use.

### localFileTree.ts

`client/src/utils/localFileTree.ts` exports `buildLocalFileTree(files: FileList)` which converts a browser `FileList` (from `<input webkitdirectory>`) into a `FileNode` tree + a `Map<relativePath, File>`. Each node's `path` is the `webkitRelativePath` (e.g. `"myproject/src/index.ts"`), which makes paths stable for identity comparisons in `useOpenFiles`. Directories are sorted before files; siblings are sorted case-insensitively.

## Coding Assistant

The Coding Assistant supports three AI providers. Select a provider and model from the dropdowns in the tab header. Click **?** to see API key setup instructions for the selected provider.

### Providers and API Keys

| Provider | Key source | Models |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Anthropic** | `~/.anthropic/api_key` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 / 4.5 / 3.7 |
| **OpenAI** | `OPENAI_TOKEN` env var | GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, o3, o4-mini |
| **Google** | `GEMINI_API_KEY` env var | Gemini 2.5 Flash / Pro, 2.0 Flash |

The default provider is **OpenAI** and the default model is **GPT-4o** (set via `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` / `DEFAULT_MODEL` in `client/src/providers.ts`).

For Anthropic, the key file is checked first (`~/.anthropic/api_key`), then the env var. If Claude Code is installed, its key is reused automatically.

The UI shows a warning banner when the selected provider's key is not configured.

Provider and model lists are defined in `client/src/providers.ts`. Adding a new provider requires only a new entry there plus a matching agent service on the server.

### Agentic Loop

The loop runs entirely server-side (one service per provider). All three share the same tool layer (`fileTools.ts`). The client receives only SSE events:

| SSE event | Payload | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `text_delta` | `{ text }` | Streamed answer token |
| `thought_delta` | `{ text }` | Streamed reasoning/"thinking" token (hidden from end user unless UI chooses to show it) |
| `tool_call` | `{ id, name, input }` | Model is invoking a tool |
| `tool_result` | `{ tool_use_id, name, preview, error }` | Tool finished |
| `done` | `{}` | Turn complete |
| `error` | `{ message }` | Server-side error |

`thought_delta` is optional: services emit it only if the agent prompt instructs the model to reveal its private reasoning (e.g., a "THOUGHTS:" section). The updated client (`useCodingAssistant.ts`) handles this event type and renders it as a muted italic line so developers can watch the agent think in real time without cluttering the main answer.

### Shared File Tools

Defined in `server/src/services/fileTools.ts`; used by all three agent services:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `read_file(path)` | Reads a file from the workspace |
| `write_file(path, content)` | Writes a file; creates parent dirs if needed |
| `list_directory(path?)` | Builds a directory tree (depth 3) |
| `search_files(query, path?)` | Grep-like text search across workspace files |

All tools fail with a clear error if no workspace is set — they do not fall back to `process.cwd()`.

### Active File Context

The path of the file currently open in the editor is sent with every chat request as `activeFile`. Each agent service adds it to its system prompt so the model knows what the user is looking at.

### SSE and the Vite Proxy

The Coding Assistant's `fetch` calls go **directly to `http://localhost:3001`** in development, bypassing the Vite proxy. This is intentional — Vite's proxy closes its backend connection shortly after forwarding the first SSE chunk, aborting the agent loop. The file watcher (`useFileWatcher`) uses the same bypass for the same reason. See `DEBUGGING.md` for full details.

Non-streaming requests (file tree, file content, workspace, status) continue to go through the Vite proxy at `/api/*` as normal.

## System View

The System View tab renders and edits architecture diagrams stored as JSON. Graph files live at `~/.iodine/<md5(workspacePath)>/system-graph.json` — scoped per workspace, never committed to git.

### JSON Schema

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "api", "name": "API", "subname": "Express/3001", "color": "#2e5e2e", "x": 320, "y": 240 }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "source": "client", "target": "api", "type": "bidirectional", "label": "HTTP" }
  ]
}
```

Edge types: `directed` (→), `bidirectional` (↔), `undirected` (dashed, no arrows).

### AI Generate

Clicking **⚡ Generate** calls `POST /api/system-graph/generate` with the current `provider` and `model`. The server runs the full agentic loop (same loop as the Coding Assistant) with a custom system prompt instructing the model to:
1. Use `list_directory` and `read_file` tools to explore the actual workspace.
2. Read key files: `package.json`, `README`, entry points, config, service definitions.
3. Output **only** a JSON object matching the graph schema above — no prose, no fences.

The `customSystemPrompt` parameter was added to `runAgentLoop`, `runOpenAIAgentLoop`, and `runGeminiAgentLoop` to support this. The provider/model state is owned by `RightPanel` and shared between both the Coding Assistant and System View tabs.

### SVG Renderer

Key implementation details in `SystemView.tsx`:

- `rectEdgePt(fx, fy, tx, ty)` — clips edge endpoints to node rectangle boundaries so arrowheads sit flush at node edges.
- `autoLayout(nodes, edges)` — 300-iteration spring-force layout (repulsion + spring attraction + gravity); only runs for nodes that have no saved position.
- SVG markers: `arrow-bidi-rev` uses `orient="auto"` (not `orient="auto-start-reverse"`) with a backward-pointing path so the arrowhead tip is at `refX="0"` and the body extends toward the target.
- Coordinate transform: `svgCoord(clientX, clientY)` accounts for current `pan` and `scale` to convert mouse events to graph space.
