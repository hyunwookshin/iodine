# Iodine — Few Drops of IDE Essentials — Developer Notes

## Light / Dark Mode

Theme support is client-side and uses shared CSS variables so components do not need separate light and dark implementations.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `client/src/hooks/useTheme.ts` | Owns the `light` / `dark` state, reads and writes the `iodine-theme` local-storage preference, falls back to `prefers-color-scheme`, and sets `data-theme` plus `color-scheme` on `<html>`. |
| `client/src/components/layout/WorkbenchLayout.tsx` | Mounts `useTheme()` and passes the current theme and toggle callback to the menu bar. |
| `client/src/components/layout/MenuBar.tsx` | Renders the sun/moon toggle and calls `onToggleTheme`. |
| `client/src/index.css` | Defines the default dark tokens in `:root` and light overrides in `:root[data-theme='light']`. The activity bar, sidebars, editor, tabs, assistant, terminal tray, inputs, previews, canvas, borders, text, icons, and scrollbars consume these variables. |
| `client/src/components/editor/MonacoEditor.tsx` | Selects Monaco's `light` or `vs-dark` theme from `document.documentElement.dataset.theme`. |
| `client/src/components/right/SystemView.tsx` | Applies the matching Monaco theme to the System View JSON editor. |
| `client/src/components/bottom/TerminalSession.tsx` | Builds the xterm theme from CSS variables and observes the root `data-theme` attribute so existing sessions update without reconnecting. |
| `client/src/components/bottom/TerminalPanel.tsx` | Styles the terminal tab strip, active tab, labels, and controls with shared theme variables. |
| `client/src/components/right/CodingAssistant.tsx` | Uses theme variables for assistant cards, command text, and live terminal-command output. |

When adding or changing UI, use the existing `--color-*` variables rather than hard-coded dark colors. Add a semantic token to both `:root` and `:root[data-theme='light']` when no suitable variable exists. Canvas-rendered or third-party widgets such as xterm and Monaco do not automatically inherit CSS colors; explicitly update their theme when `data-theme` changes.
